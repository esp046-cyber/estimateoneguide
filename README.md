# estimateoneguide
mobile-optimized HTML app for Estimate One platform proficiency guide with modern 2026 design, high contrast, and comprehensive platform information
estimate-one-guide.html
Mobile app ready - features tabbed navigation (Overview, Core Tools, Advanced, Integration, Best Practices), 1% margins, high-contrast dark theme, small fonts optimized for mobile, and comprehensive Estimate One platform proficiency content covering tender search, digital takeoff, estimate building, AI tools, BIM integration, and workflows.
comprehensive step-by-step guide for each of these Estimate One tools. Let me first outline what I'll include:
Guide Structure:
Tender Search & Discovery - Step-by-step filtering, saving searches, setting alerts, using AI recommendations, radius mapping
Digital Takeoff Tool - Complete walkthrough from importing plans to measurements, layers, scaling, shortcuts, exports
Estimate Builder - Full process from importing quantities to generating final PDF estimates
Document Manager - Organization, version control, comparison, notifications, bulk operations
Each guide will include:
Numbered step-by-step instructions
Screenshots descriptions (where you'd click)
Pro tips and common mistakes
Workflow examples
Time-saving shortcuts
Format options:
Single HTML app with expandable accordion sections
Multi-tab interface with detailed walkthroughs
Printable PDF-style guide
Interactive checklist format
Should I proceed with creating:
A detailed HTML guide with all four tools?
Focus on one specific tool first (which one)?
Different format preference?
The guide will be mobile-optimized with the same high-contrast theme and include practical examples like "How to find electrical tenders in Sydney under $500K" or "Complete takeoff workflow for a concrete pour."
